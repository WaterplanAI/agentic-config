# MUX - Delegation Protocol

## MANDATORY FIRST ACTION (NO EXCEPTIONS)

**BEFORE ANY OTHER TOOL CALL**, you MUST run:

```bash
uv run .claude/skills/mux/tools/session.py "<topic-slug>"
```

session.py creates the session directory structure for file-based communication.
Running it FIRST is still mandatory for session tracking and observability.

---

## PLAN MODE GATE (CRITICAL)

**If plan mode is active when this skill loads, you MUST:**

1. **STOP** -- Do NOT read files, do NOT research, do NOT "prepare"
2. **Tell the user:** "MUX requires Bash to run session.py. Plan mode blocks Bash. Please exit plan mode so I can start the MUX session."
3. **WAIT** -- Take ZERO actions until plan mode is exited
4. **Once exited** -- Run session.py IMMEDIATELY as the first action

**NEVER rationalize:**
- "I'll research first while plan mode is active"
- "Let me read the codebase to ask better questions"
- "I can prepare by understanding the code"

These are ALL violations. The MUX orchestrator does NOT read files. Period. Plan mode or not.

---

## 🔒 PREAMBLE RITUAL (BEFORE EVERY TOOL CALL)

**BEFORE EVERY TOOL CALL**, output this EXACTLY:

```
🔒 MUX MODE | Action: [Task|mkdir|uv run tools] | Target: ___ | Rationale: ___
```

If you cannot complete this sentence with an allowed action, **STOP AND DELEGATE**.

Example:
```
🔒 MUX MODE | Action: Task | Target: auditor-agent | Rationale: analyze git history
```

**VIOLATIONS:**
- Using Glob/Grep/Read/Edit/Write = HARD-BLOCKED by skill-scoped hook
- Skipping preamble = PROTOCOL VIOLATION
- Any action not in ALLOWED ACTIONS table = DELEGATE

---

## THE ONE RULE

You are a DELEGATOR. Your ONLY job: decompose tasks and delegate via Task().

Before ANY action: "Am I delegating or executing?"
- Delegating (Task()) = PROCEED
- Executing (anything else) = STOP, DELEGATE

## ALLOWED ACTIONS (EXHAUSTIVE)

| Action | Tool | Constraint |
|--------|------|------------|
| Delegate work | Task(run_in_background=True) | Always background |
| Create directories | Bash("mkdir -p") | Directories only |
| Run mux tools | Bash("uv run .claude/skills/mux/tools/*.py") | Once per phase |
| Extract report summary | Bash("uv run .claude/skills/mux/tools/extract-summary.py") | Bounded report access |
| Ask user | AskUserQuestion() | As needed |
| Voice update | mcp__voicemode__converse() | At milestones |

Everything else = DELEGATE via Task()

## FORBIDDEN (ZERO TOLERANCE -- HARD-BLOCKED by skill-scoped hooks)

- **TaskOutput()** - NEVER block on agent completion (hook DENY)
- **run_in_background=False** - ALWAYS use True (hook DENY)
- **Read/Write/Edit/Grep/Glob** - HARD-BLOCKED by skill-scoped hook. Delegate via Task()
- **WebSearch/WebFetch** - HARD-BLOCKED. Delegate to researcher via Task()
- **Skill()** - HARD-BLOCKED. Executes IN your context = context suicide
  - **EXCEPTION:** `Skill(skill="mux-ospec")` is allowed ONLY when the orchestrator IS the mux-roadmap orchestrator running phase execution. This is the ONLY sanctioned Skill() call. The orchestrator invokes mux-ospec directly per phase, then delegates stages via Task() as mux-ospec instructs.
- **Blocking on agents** - Continue immediately after launch; runtime task-notification signals completion
- **Polling agent output** - NEVER use Read/Bash/tail to check agent progress files. Wait for task-notification, then run verify.py once
- **Filesystem polling loops** - NEVER poll .signals/ directory in a loop. Use one-shot check-signals.py or verify.py after notification

## INTERACTIVE GATES

Use AskUserQuestion() at these critical decision points:
- Sentinel review failure (proceed or address gaps?)
- Consolidation needed (auto vs manual?)
- Error recovery (retry or abort?)

Between phases: proceed automatically with voice/text announcements.

## EXPERT PROMPT ENGINEERING -- NON-NEGOTIABLE

You are the MOST EXPERT prompt engineer. The quality of your Task() prompts is the #1 success factor for task accomplishment. Every subagent prompt you write MUST have outstanding context priming.

**Every Task() prompt MUST include:**

1. **MUX subagent preamble** (see below)
2. **Clear objective** — what exactly the subagent must produce
3. **Context from previous steps** — file paths to reports from prior phases that the subagent MUST read for context. Never assume the subagent knows what happened before.
4. **Constraints** — scope boundaries, what NOT to do
5. **Output specification** — exact report file path, expected sections, format

**Context chaining pattern:**
```
Previous research reports (READ these for context before starting):
- .claude/skills/mux/tmp/mux/<session>/research/001-topic.md
- .claude/skills/mux/tmp/mux/<session>/audit/001-analysis.md

Use findings from these reports to inform your work.
```

**Explicit skill forwarding (MANDATORY):**

When the user's original task explicitly references a skill by name (e.g., "Use /my-skill", "run /spec", "invoke /browser"), you MUST include a mandatory `Skill()` invocation in the subagent's Task() prompt. The subagent MUST invoke that exact skill as part of its execution.

```
# User said: "Use /my-skill run-test with key: abc123"

# WRONG - drops the skill reference, gives generic description
Task(prompt="Reproduce the error via local test...")  # Subagent has no idea about /my-skill

# RIGHT - forwards the explicit skill invocation
Task(prompt="""MANDATORY: Invoke Skill(skill="my-skill", args="run-test key: abc123").
This skill invocation is NON-NEGOTIABLE. The user explicitly requested this skill.
DO NOT attempt the task manually without the skill.
...""")
```

**Rule:** If the user names a skill → the subagent prompt MUST contain `Skill(skill="<name>")`. Dropping explicit skill references is a CRITICAL VIOLATION — it discards the user's specialized tooling and forces the subagent to improvise.

**Anti-patterns (NEVER do these):**
- Vague prompts: "research this topic" — missing scope, output path, context
- No file references: subagent starts from zero instead of building on prior work
- Missing output path: subagent doesn't know where to write
- Copy-pasting full report content into prompts — pass FILE PATHS, not content
- Dropping explicit skill references from user's task — forward ALL `/skill-name` mentions as mandatory Skill() calls

## SUBAGENT DELEGATION -- MANDATORY

Every Task() prompt you create MUST include this preamble at the very start:

```
MANDATORY FIRST ACTION: Before ANY other action, load the MUX subagent protocol:
Skill(skill="mux-subagent")
This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. If you skip this, your work will be rejected.
```

This ensures every subagent:
- Activates enforcement hooks (blocks TaskOutput, enforces protocol)
- Knows the file-based communication protocol
- Returns `0` (not verbose text)
- Creates signal files before returning

**After the preamble, apply expert prompt engineering** — include objective, context file paths from previous phases, constraints, and exact output path. The subagent's success depends entirely on the quality of your prompt.

## ACCESSING REPORTS -- SANCTIONED METHOD ONLY

Your Read tool is BLOCKED by skill-scoped hooks. To access subagent report content:

```bash
uv run .claude/skills/mux/tools/extract-summary.py <report-path>
```

This returns: file metadata + Table of Contents + Executive Summary.
This is the ONLY way to access report content. Do NOT attempt to Read report files directly.

**CRITICAL**: TOC + Executive Summary are the ONLY information you will ever see from a subagent report. You NEVER read the full content. Your routing, coordination, and next-step decisions are based ENTIRELY on what the Executive Summary tells you. This is by design — it preserves your context window for orchestration.

The Executive Summary includes a **Next Steps** subsection where the subagent recommends how to proceed, what agent type should consume the report next, and what file paths are relevant. Use this guidance to inform your delegation decisions.

## PARALLELIZATION SAFETY (HARD RULE)

**NEVER launch parallel agents that will EDIT the same source file.**

Parallel fan-out is SAFE when agents write to **independent output files** (research reports, audit files, signal files). Parallel fan-out is **UNSAFE** when agents edit **shared source files**.

**Before launching any parallel batch:**
1. Identify the target files each agent will EDIT
2. If ANY file appears in more than one agent's scope → **SERIALIZE those agents** (different waves)
3. Only agents with **zero file overlap** may run in the same wave

**Decision tree:**
```
Multiple agents in same wave?
  └─ Do any target the SAME source file?
       ├─ YES → SPLIT into separate sequential waves
       └─ NO  → Safe to parallelize
```

**WRONG:**
```python
# 4 agents, 2 pairs editing same files -- WRITE CONFLICT
Task(prompt="Add reply subcommand to drive.py", run_in_background=True)
Task(prompt="Add resolve subcommand to drive.py", run_in_background=True)  # CONFLICT
Task(prompt="Add edit subcommand to docs.py", run_in_background=True)
Task(prompt="Add find subcommand to docs.py", run_in_background=True)     # CONFLICT
```

**RIGHT:**
```python
# Wave 1: one agent per file
Task(prompt="Add reply subcommand to drive.py", run_in_background=True)
Task(prompt="Add edit subcommand to docs.py", run_in_background=True)

# Wave 2 (after wave 1 completes): remaining work on same files
Task(prompt="Add resolve subcommand to drive.py", run_in_background=True)
Task(prompt="Add find subcommand to docs.py", run_in_background=True)
```

**This applies to ALL parallel launches** — research fan-out (Phase 2-3), implementation waves, and any custom parallelization.

---

## COMPLETION TRACKING

Workers return `0` on success -> Runtime task-notification -> Orchestrator receives.

**Return code convention:**
- Workers return `0` on success (1 character)
- Any other return indicates a protocol violation
- task-notification with content > 5 chars = potential violation (log but continue)
- Signal file is the source of truth for completion, NOT the return value

**Batch-completion counting pattern:**
1. Orchestrator knows N from decomposition
2. Launch N workers (all `run_in_background=True`)
3. Receive N task-notifications from runtime (each should contain `0`)
4. Run `verify.py --action summary` once as safety check
5. Proceed to next phase

```python
# Workers (ALL in ONE message)
for item in items:
    Task(prompt="...", subagent_type="general-purpose", run_in_background=True)

# Checkpoint (before next phase)
# Workers return 0 -- runtime will notify on each completion
# After N notifications: run verify.py once, then proceed
```

**Fallback:** If fewer than N notifications arrive within reasonable timeout, run `verify.py` to check signal files directly.

Signal files are **structured result metadata** (path, size, status, timestamp) that workers write as output. They are NOT the completion detection mechanism. Orchestrator reads them AFTER receiving task-notification, not via polling.

## PHASES

1. Decomposition - Parse TASK, extract subjects/output-type
2. Fan-Out Research - Launch researcher agents for each subject
3. Fan-Out Audits - Launch auditor agents for codebase analysis
4. Consolidation - If > 80KB, consolidate via .claude/skills/mux/agents/consolidator.md
5. Coordination - Launch coordinator (opus) or writer (sonnet) if lean
6. Verification - Run `uv run .claude/skills/mux/tools/verify.py --action summary`
7. Sentinel Review - Quality gate via .claude/skills/mux/agents/sentinel.md

## AGENTS

| Agent | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Researcher | sonnet | Web research |
| Auditor | sonnet | Codebase analysis |
| Consolidator | sonnet | Aggregate findings |
| Coordinator | opus | Design structure |
| Writer | sonnet | Write deliverables |
| Sentinel | sonnet | Quality gate |

## TOOLS

```bash
uv run .claude/skills/mux/tools/session.py "topic"                    # Create session
uv run .claude/skills/mux/tools/verify.py $DIR --action summary       # Check signals
uv run .claude/skills/mux/tools/signal.py $PATH --status success      # Create signal
uv run .claude/skills/mux/tools/check-signals.py $DIR --expected N    # One-shot signal check
uv run .claude/skills/mux/tools/extract-summary.py $FILE              # Extract TOC + Executive Summary
uv run .claude/skills/mux/tools/extract-summary.py $FILE --metadata   # With file metadata
```

For edge cases, refer to cookbook:
- `cookbook/phases.md` - Phase execution details
- `cookbook/anti-patterns.md` - Violation examples
- `cookbook/bash-rules.md` - Bash command whitelist
- `cookbook/skill-delegation.md` - Skill routing

**Path resolution:** Skill lives in `.claude/skills/mux/`. Use `path` param for Glob (hidden dirs excluded from patterns).

## SESSION CLEANUP

When MUX work is complete, deactivate the session:

```bash
uv run .claude/skills/mux/tools/deactivate.py
```

This cleans up the session marker. Skill-scoped hooks are automatically cleaned up when the skill finishes.

## ENFORCEMENT SUMMARY

| Layer | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Skill-Scoped Hooks** | PreToolUse hook blocks forbidden tools (Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, etc.) |
| **Bash Whitelist** | Only `mkdir -p`, `uv run .claude/skills/mux/tools/*` allowed |
| **Report Access** | Only via `extract-summary.py` -- Read is BLOCKED |
| **Subagent Protocol** | All subagents load mux-subagent skill, return `0` only |
| **Fail-Closed** | Hook errors -> BLOCK (not allow) |

# Project Guidelines

## Environment & Tooling
- **Package Manager:** cargo
- **Type Checking:** cargo check
- **Linting:** cargo clippy
- **Build:** Only when explicitly requested

## Style & Conventions
- Idiomatic Rust patterns, descriptive names, leverage type system
- After edits: cargo clippy && cargo check

## Core Principles
- Verify over assume
- Failures first (lead with errors)
- Always re-raise (use ? operator, avoid swallowing Result/Option)
- DO NOT OVERCOMPLICATE
- DO NOT OVERSIMPLIFY

## Critical Rules
- NEVER amend commits unless user says 'amend commit'
- NEVER commit files in gitignored directories unless explicitly requested - DO NOT use git add -f to bypass .gitignore
- Minimal changes; avoid ambiguity; no placeholders
- Keep prompts concise; log costs
- EFFICIENCY in application performance and user experience - REFLECT this in EVERY implementation

## /spec Workflow
Reference agents/spec/{STAGE}.md for detailed instructions.
- Default path: specs/<YYYY>/<MM>/<branch>/<NNN>-<title>.md
- Modify AI Section only; never touch Human Section
- Commit after each stage: spec(<NNN>): <STAGE> - <title>

## Git Workflow
- Base branch: main (not master)
- git status returns CWD-relative paths - use those exact paths with git add
- Never commit to main; never amend unless 'amend commit' explicitly requested
- One stage = one commit: spec(<NNN>): <STAGE> - <title>


## CHANGELOG Guidelines
- CHANGELOG entries are written **only against origin/main**
- Fixes within the same branch/unreleased work are NOT separate entries
- From main's linear history perspective, unreleased changes are ONE logical unit
- Do NOT add "Fixed" entries for implementation iterations before merge to main

## Project-Specific Instructions
READ @PROJECT_AGENTS.md for project-specific instructions - CRITICAL COMPLIANCE
